  - Addition
  - Subtraction
  - Multiplication
  - Division
- Learned how Java executes code line by line

***

### 🔹 Day 2 – Operators in Java
- Practiced **Relational Operators**
  - `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`
- Understood **true/false conditions**
- Explored **Bitwise Operators**
  - `&`, `|`, `^`, `~`
- Learned **Bitwise Shift Operators**
  - `<<`, `>>`, `>>>`
- Observed behavior of signed vs unsigned shifts

***

### 🔹 Day 3 – Mathematical Formulas Using Java
- Implemented real-life math formulas using Java:
  - Simple Interest
  - Circumference & Area of Circle
  - Perimeter & Area of Rectangle
  - Perimeter & Area of Triangle
  - Curved Surface Area, Total Surface Area & Volume of Cuboid
- Used:
  - `int` and `double` data types
  - `Math.PI`
- Improved formatting and output readability

***

### 🔹 Day 4 – Basic Calculator (Using Conditional Statements)
- Built a **menu-driven calculator**
- Used:
  - `Scanner` class for user input
  - `if-else` statements
- Supported operations:
  - Addition
  - Subtraction
  - Multiplication
  - Division
- Learned how programs respond to user choices

***

### 🔹 Day 5 – Inheritance in Java (OOP Concept)
- Learned **Inheritance** and its importance in OOP
- Studied **Legal Inheritance Types**:
  - Single-level inheritance
  - Multi-level inheritance
  - Hierarchical inheritance
- Implemented:
  - `GrandFather`, `Father`, and multiple child classes
- Understood:
  - Code reusability
  - Parent-child relationship between classes

***

### 🔹 Day 6 – Arrays in Java
- Created an array
- Read elements using `Scanner`
- Printed all elements using a loop
- Understood:
  - Indexing
  - Fixed size nature of arrays
  - Use of loops with arrays

***

### 🔹 Day 7 – Conditional Statements in Java
- Learned decision-making in Java using:
  - `if / else`
  - Multiple `if` statements
  - `if-else ladder`
  - Nested `if`
  - **Dangling else problem**
  - `switch-case`
  - **Ternary operator**
- Compared when and why each conditional structure is used
- Built logical thinking and control flow understanding

***

###🔹 Day 8 – Improved Calculator using switch-case
- Rebuilt the Basic Calculator in a cleaner and more efficient way
- Used modern switch-case expressions for better readability
- Reduced code complexity and improved performance
- Learned:
  - switch expressions with arrow (->) syntax
  - Input validation before execution
  - Writing concise and maintainable code
- Key Concepts Practiced
- Scanner class for user input
- Conditional logic and branching
- Switch expression
- Clean code structure

*** 

🔹 Day 9 – Loops in Java

-Learned how to repeat tasks efficiently using loops
-Explored different types of loops and their use cases:
  -'for' loop for fixed iterations
  -'while' loop for condition-based execution
  -'do-while' loop that executes at least once
-Understood loop control statements:
  -'break' to exit a loop immediately
  -'continue' to skip the current iteration
-Implemented nested loops for pattern printing
-Built a strong foundation for automation and iterative logic
