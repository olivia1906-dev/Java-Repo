*** 

🔹 Day 9 – Loops in Java

-Learned how to repeat tasks efficiently using loops
-Explored different types of loops and their use cases:
  -'for' loop for fixed iterations
  -'while' loop for condition-based execution
  -'do-while' loop that executes at least once
-Understood loop control statements:
  -'break' to exit a loop immediately
  -'continue' to skip the current iteration
-Implemented nested loops for pattern printing
-Built a strong foundation for automation and iterative logic

***

🔹 Day 10 – Arrays in Java

-Concepts Covered
  - One-dimensional arrays (1D)
  - Two-dimensional arrays (2D)
  - Accessing array elements using indexes
  - Modifying array values
  - Using loops to traverse arrays
-Program Features
  - Takes user input to create a 1D array
  - Displays all elements using a loop
  - Modifies the first element of the array
  - Creates a 2D array using rows and columns
  - Accepts and displays matrix values using nested loops

Key Learning-
Arrays store multiple values of the same type in a single variable. They are foundational for advanced topics like sorting, searching, and data structures.

***

🔹 Day 11 – Sum and Average of Array Elements

-Concepts Covered
  -One-dimensional arrays
  -Loop traversal (for loop)
  -Accumulator variables
  -Type casting (int to double)

-Basic arithmetic operations
  -Program Description
  -Accepts array size from the user
  -Takes integer elements as input
  -Calculates the sum of all elements
  -Computes and displays the average

Key Learning-
Arrays combined with loops allow efficient processing of large datasets. Understanding how calculations work with different data types is critical for accurate results.

***

🔹 Day 11 – Pattern Printing & Nested Loops in Java
