**********************
 ==    :    equal to tells if two numbers are equal. 
 ! =    :    not equal tells if two numbers are not equal.
 >      :    greater than tells if number 1 is greater than number 2 or not. 
 <      :    lesser than tells if number 1 is lesser than number 2 or not.
 >=    :    greater than or equal  to tells if number 1 is greater than or 	equal to number 2.
 <=    :    lesser than or equal to tells if number 1 is lesser than equal to number 2.


 &     :    bitwise and performs logical AND between 2 number's binary form
 |      :   bitwise or performs logical OR between 2 number's binary form.
 ^     :    bitwise exclusive or performs logical EX-OR between 2 number's binary form.
 ~     :   bitwise not performs logical NOT on each bit of a number.
<<    :    bitwise left shift shifts binary bits of the number by the given number in left direction
>>    :    bitwise right shift shifts binary bits of the number by the given number in right direction.
>>>  :    bitwise unsigned right shift is similar to bitwise right shift is just different if the number is negative.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DAY 7 – Conditional Statements (Deep Dive)

### What you did in code

* Used:

         1. if / else Statement
         *  Used when there are ONLY TWO possible outcomes
         *  If condition is true → if block runs
         *  Otherwise → else block runs

         2. Multiple if Statements
         *  Each if is checked SEPARATELY
         *  More than one condition can be true
         *  All true conditions will execute

         3. if-else Ladder
         *  Conditions are checked TOP to BOTTOM
         *  ONLY ONE block executes
         *  As soon as a condition is true, remaining checks STOP

         * 4. Dangling else
         *  Occurs when braces { } are NOT used
         *  else always matches the NEAREST if
         *  Can cause confusion → avoid in real projects

         * 5. switch-case
         *  Used when comparing ONE variable with MANY fixed values
         *  Cleaner than multiple else-if for fixed choices
         * 6. Ternary Operator
         *  Short form of if-else
         *  Used when logic is SIMPLE
         *  Syntax: condition ? trueValue : falseValue

### Concepts explained

* Decision flow
* When to use each type of `if`
* Cleaner logic using ternary
* Avoiding logical errors

### Concepts explained

* Refactoring
* Readability
* Maintainability
* Modern Java syntax


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Day 9 – Loops & Control Flow in Java

 ### For Loop

* Used when the number of iterations is known in advance
* Combines initialization, condition, and increment/decrement in one line
* Commonly used for counting, arrays, and fixed-range tasks

### While Loop

* Executes as long as the condition remains true
* Condition is checked *before* each iteration
* Useful when the number of iterations is not known beforehand

### Do-While Loop

* Executes the loop body **at least once**, regardless of the condition
* Condition is checked *after* the loop body executes
* Helpful when at least one execution is mandatory

### Break Statement

* Immediately terminates the loop
* Used when a specific condition is met and further execution is unnecessary
* Improves efficiency and control

### Continue Statement

* Skips the current iteration and moves to the next one
* Useful when certain conditions should be ignored without stopping the loop

### Nested Loops

* A loop inside another loop
* Inner loop completes all iterations for each outer loop cycle
* Commonly used in pattern printing, tables, and multidimensional arrays

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 Day 10 - arrays in Java
* Working with **one-dimensional arrays** helped me understand how multiple values of the same data type can be stored and accessed efficiently using indexes,  instead of creating multiple variables.

 * Exploring **two-dimensional arrays** introduced the idea of storing data in a row-column (matrix) format, which is extremely useful for representing tables, grids, and structured data. Using **nested loops** made it clear how Java traverses multi-level data structures.

* Modifying array elements also showed how arrays are mutable, allowing dynamic changes after initialization.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Day 11 – sum and average in array

*How to store multiple integers in an array
*How to traverse an array using a loop
*How to accumulate values using a variable (sum)
*Why type casting is needed for accurate average calculation
*Difference between integer division and decimal division

*Calculating the sum showed how values can be accumulated during traversal, while finding the average highlighted the importance of data types and type casting in Java.
*This exercise reinforced how even simple programs require clear logic and careful handling of calculations.

Important Insight:
Average must be stored in double because integer division removes decimal values.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

🔹 Day 11 – Pattern Printing (Explanation)

### Concept Used:
 *for loop
 *Nested loops

### How Loops Work Here:
 *Outer loop controls the number of rows
 *Inner loop controls:
 *Number of stars
 *Number of spaces
 *Shape of the pattern

### Pattern Logic Breakdown:
 *Solid Rectangle
    *Fixed rows and fixed columns
 *Left Half Pyramid
   *Stars increase with each row
 *Right Aligned Pyramid
    *Spaces decrease, stars increase
 *Full Pyramid
    *Stars follow formula: 2 × row − 1
 *Inverted Pyramid
    *Stars decrease row by row
 *Diamond
    *Upper pyramid + inverted pyramid
